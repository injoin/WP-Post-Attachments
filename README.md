WP Post Attachments
===================

This is a _simple but useful_ [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) plugin that will list the attachments of a post while editing it.
You need no configuration, the list will be automatically shown for all post types.

Features
---
* Listing attachments of a post (no matter the attachment type - video, image, audio or anything else)
* Easy sorting of the attachments of a post, with drag'n'drop support
* Links within each attachment to edit it, remove it or insert it into the current position in the editor

Installation
---
1. Upload the `ij-post-attachments` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. That's all! You will note that below the editor inside a post an box entitled `Images and Attachments` will appear.
